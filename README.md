# Eigenfaces in JavaScript

School project attempt to Principal Component Analysis in JavaScript
(node.js + browser). Had to resort calculating the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues in Python since JS performance wasn't quite there yet...

See http://kpuputti.github.com/eigenfaces for the app and
documentation.
